# HR-Assistant

This is a small project leveraging a RAG application connecting to OpenAI ChatGPT 3.5 aiming to provide an AI based
assistant for human ressources

## Requirements

## Installation
 To ensure running the project smoothly, I recommend to set up a virtual environment. You can do so by running
`make setup-venv`. This will create your virtual environment. You can then run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate
 it (Not mandatory).

The project dependencies can be installed running `make install` in your terminal

## Open API Key
An Open API key is mandatory to be able to use the LLM model. Follow these steps https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart.


You can check that the OpenAI API key was successfully imported configured with `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`

A demo notebook is located in demo/.

You can spin up the UI with `make run`
